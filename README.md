## Comprehensive Data Analysis and Visualization for Identifying Tuberculosis Trends and Patterns

### Abstract
Global Tuberculosis (TB) Program is governed by
WHO, which strives for a TB-free world with no TB-related
deaths, illnesses, or suffering. The team’s goal is to lead and
coordinate the worldwide campaign to end the TB epidemic via
multisectoral action, innovation, and universal access to peoplecentered
prevention and care. In this study we answer the
following questions:
1) What are the risk factors involved in TB case infections
with respect to different regions?
2) What is the low, high, and best estimate for each country
with respect to the total population?
3) What are the cost of different Programs (including Budget,
Expected Funding, Actual Expenditure, and Funds
Received)?
4) What is the number of patients expected to start Multi
Drug-Resistant TB (MDR-TB) treatment with respect to
the facilities they choose?
